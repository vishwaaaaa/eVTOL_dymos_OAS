# eVTOL_dymos_OAS
This respository contains the code for the trajectory optimization of eVTOL trajectory which OAS for aerodynamics optimization. The tandem phases is not implemented here.

This version has contains the phase1 : Cruise with the CL and CD being supplied from simple aero model. 'alpha' : which is the angle of attack is only controlled by dymos.
