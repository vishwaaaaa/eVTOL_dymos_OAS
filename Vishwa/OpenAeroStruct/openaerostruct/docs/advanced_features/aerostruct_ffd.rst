Aerostructural FFD
==================

In additional to OpenAeroStruct's internal geometry manipulation group, you can also use `pyGeo` to perform free-form deformation (FFD) manipulation on the mesh.
This allows for more general design shape changes and helps sync up geometry changes between meshes from different levels of fidelity.

.. warning::
  This example requires `pyGeo`, an external code developed by the MDO Lab. You can install it from `here <https://github.com/mdolab/pygeo>`_.
