.. _Mission Analysis using OpenConcept:

Integrating Mission Analysis
============================

You can perform aerodynamic or aerostructural wing design optimization considering full mission analysis by integrating OpenAeroStruct with `OpenConcept <https://github.com/mdolab/openconcept>`_.
OpenConcept is a toolkit for aircraft conceptual design, which is also built on top of the OpenMDAO framework.

Examples of the OpenAeroStruct-OpenConcept coupled work can be found in OpenConcept `repository <https://github.com/mdolab/openconcept>`_ and `documentation <https://mdolab-openconcept.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_.
