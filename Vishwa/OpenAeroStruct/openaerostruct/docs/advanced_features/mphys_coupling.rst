MPhys Integration
=================

OpenAeroStruct provides an interface for coupling its internal solvers with `MPhys <https://github.com/OpenMDAO/mphys>`_.
MPhys is a package that standardizes multiphysics problems in OpenMDAO across multiple fidelity levels.
MPhys eases the problem set up, provides straightforward extension to new disciplines, and has a library of OpenMDAO groups for multidisciplinary problems addressed by its standard.
The MPhys library currently supports from the following libraries: `ADFlow <https://github.com/mdolab/adflow>`_, `DAFoam <https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam>`_, `FunToFEM <https://github.com/smdogroup/funtofem>`_,
`pyCycle <https://github.com/OpenMDAO/pyCycle>`_, `pyGeo <https://github.com/mdolab/pygeo>`_, and `TACS <https://github.com/smdogroup/tacs>`_.

.. note:: Currently, only OpenAeroStruct's aerodynamic solver is supported in the MPhys wrapper. The structural solver has yet to be added.

This potentially gives OpenAeroStruct the capability to be coupled with any of the above mentioned libraries.
One could, for example, couple a 3D high-fidelity wingbox structural model in TACS with a VLM aerodynamic wing model in OpenAerostruct using FunToFEM's load/displacement coupling scheme.
The following shows an example of a result from a from such an analysis.

The script below shows an example of how to setup and run the MPhys interface.
The example couples pyGeo's OpenVSP parameterization with OpenAeroStruct's aerodynamic solver to perform an aerodynamic optimization.
The interface will also write out aerodynamic solutions in a ``.plt`` file format that can open and viewed in TecPlot.
